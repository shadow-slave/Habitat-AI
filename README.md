# 🏙️ Habitat-AI (Hackquest: Limitless Minds)

> **A Hyper-Local Audit & Transparency Platform for MSRIT Students**

**Habitat-AI** is a community-driven digital solution designed to bridge the trust gap between students and local service providers in Mathikere and New BEL Road. It empowers students to audit PGs, monitor Mess hygiene, and make informed decisions using AI-driven insights.

## 🚀 The Problem
Students in Mathikere face information asymmetry: misleading PG ads, opaque rent structures, and inconsistent mess hygiene. There is no centralized, data-driven platform to verify these essential services.

## 💡 The Solution
We propose a three-tiered audit system:
1.  **Accommodation Audit:** Verified ratings for amenities (Wi-Fi, Backup Power, Safety).
2.  **Nutrition Monitor:** Time-stamped photo logs for tracking Mess hygiene consistency.
3.  **AI Summarizer:** Google Gemini integration to convert hundreds of text reviews into instant "Pros & Cons" lists.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite), Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
* **AI Engine:** Google Gemini API (NLP & Summarization)
* **Storage:** Cloudinary (Image Hosting)

## ⚡ Features
* **✅ Truth-Lens:** Users upload photos to verify claims (e.g., "Real vs. Ad").
* **🧠 Vibe-Check (AI):** Automatically summarizes reviews (e.g., "Cons: Salty food, Rude warden").
* **📍 Safety Map:** Geolocation tagging for PGs to identify safe/unsafe zones.
* **📊 Live Dashboard:** Visual charts for Hygiene and Safety trends over time.
